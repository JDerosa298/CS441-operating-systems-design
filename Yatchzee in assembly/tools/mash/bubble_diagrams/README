This directory contains scripts and data generated (in part by mash)
that create railrod diagrams of the mash assembly language for use
on the MiniAT.org website and in printed documentation.  Currently,
only the image version for print and web is functional.  Another, a
text HTML/CSS-based diagram creater, is not yet complete, and a third,
which creates text BNF, is not yet started.

To create all working image diagram models, execute the
"bubble-generator.tcl" script (requires TCL/Tk and ImageMagick) and
click the "Everything" button in the Tk window that appears.
